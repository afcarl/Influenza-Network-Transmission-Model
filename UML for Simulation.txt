UML for Simulation

Class Virus
	Has Segment
		Segment Number --> Can associate with Protein Name
		Sequence of 0s and 1s --> Can compute Length
	Has Timestamp of Birth

	Can Mutate
		Randomly select one position in one segment and flip its sequence.
			0 --> 1
			1 --> 0


Basic steps:
1. Initialize M viruses, each with sequence length N
2. At each time step, randomly select one virus and clone it.
3. Run simulation fo X time steps.
4. Compute PWI between each sampled virus.
5. Reconstruct network.
